== Story

=== Prologue

// aka Intro at the doctor's

Play a scene where I go to my doctor/psychologist.

Him: Oh, Mr. Sablonnière, I haven't seen you in 10 years!
Him: Last time you were just starting your first job, are you still suffering from the trauma we discussed last time?
Me: Oh, the tabs vs. space debate? Yeah, I solved that problem years ago, it's fine.
Him: And have you settled on how to pronounce ggif?
Me: Yeah, and it's pronounced jif
Him: OK, so why are you here, what is troubling you?
Me: Well, I've been working on lots of projects, I specialized in Web stuffs, especially on the frontend and I feel old, fatigued and lost
Him: Tell me more, tell me how you feel...
Me: I have mean thoughts about some stuffs but I cannot share them in a conference
Him: But it's just the two of us, we're covered by secrecy, nobody will hear you here
...
// "Over-sad" state about the global state of the Web
Me: I feel like a lot of developers are following fashions like sheeps
Me: When I watch a react conference, I feel like attending an Apple Keynote from the good old Steve Jobs era.
Me: I want people to build more robust code, that is less subject to time and fashion
...
Me: It's what I feel, I'm about to talk about this topic in a big conference but I cannot say it like that.
Him: Your an engineer Mr. Sablonnière, remember your teachings, approach this problem with a scientific and balanced point of view
Him: I'm sure you'll find a way to share your frustrations without calling React developers fanboys.

=== Hello (with talk title)

Hello everyone, my name is Hubert Sablonnière, I'm a Web Developer at Clever Cloud and today, I'd like to talk about,
my TV.

// Move the TV analogy ot the intro?

10 years ago, I save some money during my last intership and then I bought a brand new TV after my first month as an employee.
// my TV is just a TV
// not a smart TV with WiFi and lame apps
// no integrated VCR
// no integrated DVD player
// Along the years I plugged various stuffs on it
// Giant horizontal PC as a media center
// Raspberry pi (media center)
// Raspberry pi (media center + video game emulators)
// Chromecast
// Firefox Chromecast
// nexus player
// Nintendo Switch
Today, my TV works exactly the same as it did 10 years ago.
I cannot say the same for the code I wrote when I started working 10 years ago.
(the code I wrote, the tools I used, the way I developped)
// note that my nexus player plays very well with other tvs when I travel

=== How did we get here?

// we went from a document era to and apps era

Eras of Web development:

// sort and simplify this
// where is flash in this?

* Documents era
** Navigation only
* Document with forms era
** first user interactions
* + CSS
** this looks good
* + JS: DHTML era
** snowflakes
// flash?
// frameset
* + AJAX
** partial reloads
// jquery
* SPA era
** client side routing
** client side templating
// angularjs, backbone...
* RWD era
** mobile web arise
* + modern JS features (Promises, Classes, Modules, Workers)
* + Service Workers
* PWA era
* + Web Components
* SPA era II (modern frameworks, everything is a component, SPA+SSR...)
** local cache
** GraphQL
** State manager
** Modern tooling CLIs

// this latest apps era is crowded with tools, frameworks...
// We're all fascinated by what frameworks do, what features they have (and sometimes how) but we don't often stop to ask, what was the problem.
// We're so fascinated we don't look at what the others do? (frameworks and standards)
// we're so fascinated we only use foobar* features/tools that goes with foobar without thinking
// jquery-date anyone
// we got lost

=== What was the problem anyway?

// when building a modern web app, we need to:
// list stuffs we need

// if we understand the original problems we need to solve, we can figure out what kind of tools we need
// problems to solve and what standards propose (in the brain)

// load data
// display stuffs
// react to user inputs
// transform data
// upload data

// solving problems to improve UX
// solving problems to improve DX
// solving problems to improve ?? (SEO, marketing)

=== What do frameworks bring to the table?

// what are the different parts of a framework
// if we disect what frameworks propose (which parts), we can stop using them as buy all blackboxes
// if we look into what they propose (and what other propose), we can adapt our code to evolve
// separation of concerns

=== Come back to coupling problem

// Pb with frameworks

=== What do standards bring to the table?

// if we look into what's coming, we can adapt our code to that
// yesterday, today and tomorrow
// web components
// what is an HTML element
// slide justin with native elements vs custom elements
// analogy of the good isolation model of custom elements

=== Perfect solution !

// Demo, Clever Cloud example
// examples

=== Looking into the future...

isolate concerns:

* loading data
* displaying data
* navigating

what are the singletons of a browser?

examples with clever console

attention à vouloir créer des composants plug-and-play

// disappearing frameworks
// build time vs runtime
// if possible the build process should just be an improvement over the runtime
// what would be the dream?
// let your code be ready for what's coming

what's the catch with web components:

* packaged as a JavaScript module
** css is a string (sad)
** html is a template string (not that big of a deal)
** shadom dom cannot be declarative (sad for ssr)
** shadow dom, required for CSS needs JS, there fore, it's hard/useless to use it for ssr

=== Conclusion

* Ne vous enfermez pas dans un framework/écosystème !
* Analysez les briques qui composent ce framework/écosystème, leur rôle et les avantages/inconvénients qu'il apporte
* Intéressez vous aux standards pour savoir comment ils impacteront demain vos choix d'aujourd'hui
* Découpler, isoler, séparer pour mieux maitriser (perf, sécu) s'adapter au futur
* Intéressez vous à ce qui se fait dans tous ces écosystèmes (en particulier si vous êtes partisan du NIH et que vous avez votre propre framework)

== Summary of the talk

1. We have problems!
2. What would be the perfect solution?
3. How do we get close to it?

== Important parts

* What are the problems?
** Too much fashion
** DX vs UX
** Too much incompatibilities
** Too much coupling
** Not enough change resistance
*** Resistance against new stuffs from own Frameworks
*** Resistance against new stuffs from other Frameworks
*** Resistance against new stuffs from Web Standards

> I want to target the perfect solution which does not exist and see how I get there...

* What is a Web App?
** What has changed in the past 10 years?
** What did not change in the past 10 years?
** => What can we predict

* What tools do we need to create a modern Webapp?
** Ideal target

* React, Vue, Angular: what's in the box?
** Where do they come from?
** They are opinionated
** How do they solve those problems?

* Decoupling these parts is very important, it's a responsibility towards:
* your users
* your codebase and therefore you colleagues and your company
* yourself and your carreer

* What would be the best future compatible format? (the HDMI of the Web)
** What is a Web Component?
** What is the interface

* UX vs DX

* runtime vs build time features

* Open on what's coming, how our tooling will evolve
